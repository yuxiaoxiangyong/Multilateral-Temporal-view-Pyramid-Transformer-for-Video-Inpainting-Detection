This repo contains an official PyTorch implementation of our paper: [Multilateral Temporal-view Pyramid Transformer for Video Inpainting Detection.](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.11054)

## ⏰Update

- **2024-07-23:** DVI-VI/OP/CP is uploaded. 
- **2024-07-21:** 📢 Mumpy is accepted by **BMVC2024**! 
- **2024-05-08**: The repo is created. 


## ⏳Todo 
- [ ] Make model and code available. 
- [ ] Make user guideline available. 
- [ ] Provide YTVI, ~~DVI~~ and FVI dataset. 
- [ ] More analysis on why multiple-pyramid decoder.

##  📑Dataset

- Since the size of the generated image by inpainting methods can influence the richness of the provided information, we generated 224x224 inpainted images on OP and CP. However, as VI only supports 256x256 and 512x512 images, we resized them accordingly.

##  💬More Analysis

1. What is inpainting detection? And What is the solvement of former research?
